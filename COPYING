The legacy code in this distribution is covered by a simple license from CMU.
All new code in this distribution is covered by the GNU LGPL, version 2.1.

New portions of code are copyrighted by the libSieve author and maintainer,
Aaron Stone, and contributions are assumed to have thier copyrights assigned
to the libSieve author unless specifically stated and agreed to otherwise.

As of verison 2.1.4 (formerly 2.2.0_pre1) of libSieve, all code previously
held under a larger, "advertising," license from CMU has been removed or
replaced. As the new code is covered by the LGPL, the entire distribution
therefore fall under the LGPL. See section 2.b. of the GNU General Public
License for terms.

The LGPL prohibits proprietary distribution and derivation of libSieve,
but does not restrict its use by proprietary programs. You are welcome
and encouraged to use libSieve for proprietary projects, but must provide
libSieve to end users with the same rights and privileges.
