libSieve: a library for parsing, sorting and filtering your mail
----------------------------------------------------------------

This code is a standalone library providing an interpreter for RFC 3028 Sieve
and various extensions. It is based upon code distributed with the Cyrus Mail
Server prior to CMU's switch to a more restrictive license. The libSieve API
attempts to be easy to use and extensible, and replaces the more rigid API in
the Cyrus Sieve implementation.

For questions, comments, and bug reports regarding this library, please contact
Aaron Stone <aaron@serendipity.cx> directly. There are no mailing lists.

The documents listed below coincide with those features currently implemented
in libSieve. Both as these documents progress through the standardization
process and as libSieve itself matures, additional extensions and later
revisions of them will be implemented.
