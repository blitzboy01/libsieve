libSieve: a library for parsing, sorting and filtering your mail
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This code is a standalone library based upon code which had been distributed
with the Cyrus Mail Server. Currently libSieve implements two API's:
one that is based upon, and compatible with, the Sieve API as built into
the Cyrus Mail Server, as well as a new API which is very well suited to
be incorporated into other programs and is reasonably extensible.

To get in touch with the usage and development communities for libSieve,
please visit http://libsieve.sf.net/ and follow the SourceForge links to
join the mailing lists.

The documents listed below coincide with those features currently
implemented in libSieve. Both as these documents progress through the
standardization process and as libSieve itself matures, additional
extensions and later revisions of them will be implemented.
